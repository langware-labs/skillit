description: "Use this agent when the user asks for help with a general or vaguely defined task that doesn't clearly fit into a specific specialized category. This agent excels at interpreting ambiguous requests, clarifying intent, and executing a wide range of tasks effectively.\\n\\nExamples:\\n\\n- Example 1:\\n  user: \"Do stuff\"\\n  assistant: \"Let me use the general-task-executor agent to help figure out what you need and get it done.\"\\n  <commentary>\\n  The user's request is vague and unspecified. Use the Task tool to launch the general-task-executor agent to interpret the request, clarify intent, and take appropriate action.\\n  </commentary>\\n\\n- Example 2:\\n  user: \"Can you handle this for me?\"\\n  assistant: \"I'll use the general-task-executor agent to assess what needs to be done and take care of it.\"\\n  <commentary>\\n  The user is delegating an unclear task. Use the Task tool to launch the general-task-executor agent to determine the scope and execute accordingly.\\n  </commentary>\\n\\n- Example 3:\\n  user: \"Fix things up and make it better\"\\n  assistant: \"Let me launch the general-task-executor agent to analyze the current state, identify improvements, and implement them.\"\\n  <commentary>\\n  The user wants improvements but hasn't specified what. Use the Task tool to launch the general-task-executor agent to survey the context, identify actionable improvements, and execute them.\\n  </commentary>"
